This was my thesis in Machine Learning. I used Binary Classification Models to predict ADHD
using Motor Activity Data and Results from a Computerised test CPT-II.
Over time I will clean up the code and make it more accesible. To fully understand the different
scripts, a scan-read of the Thesis may help.
